<p style="font-size:20px;">New Seven Wonders of the World campaign was stated in the year 2000 to choose a new list of New7wonders of the world from a selection of 200 existing monuments. These new seven wonders were announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon, Portugal after a poll led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New7Wonders Foundation based in Zurich, Switzerland. 100 million votes were cast through the Internet or by telephone in the poll by the organisation worldwide.</p>

<h1>Petra<h1>
  <p style="font-size:15px;color:red;">Declared a World Heritage Site in 1985, Petra was the capital of the Nabataean empire of King Aretas IV, and likely existed in its prime from 9 B.C. to A.D. 40. The members of this civilization proved to be early experts in manipulating water technology, constructing intricate tunnels and water chambers, which helped create an pseudo-oasis. A number of incredible structures carved into stone, a 4,000-seat amphitheater and the El-Deir monastery have also helped the site earn its fame.
